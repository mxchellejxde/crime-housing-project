### Final Trends and Analysis:

Based on the line graph for median housing, it appears that year over year, housing costs continue to increase from 2016 to 2020. This is consistent for all counties in California. At the same time, crime is trending slightly downward throughout the same 5 years.  Looking at the crime and median housing county-by-county, we see that there is no signficant correlation between the amount of crime and the median housing price from 2016 - 2020.  Even if we hone in on the top 5 and bottom 5 counties for crime and housing, the extremes have no significant correlation from the bar graphs.
